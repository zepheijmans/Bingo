This project was a school challenge from about 6 months ago at the time of writing, where I had to create a Bingo application within a strict 4-hour time limit. Despite the deadline, I was determined to create a high-quality application that met all the project requirements.

I was able to complete the project on time and deliver a working application that met all the requirements. I'm happy to say that I won the competition! Winning the competition was a great achievement for me and a validation of my hard work and effort. I worked on the project alone, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to have learned and grown as a developer. It was a fun challenge.

However, looking back on the project now, I realize that there were areas that could have been improved, and my skills have developed significantly since then. While the Bingo application doesn't accurately represent my current skills and abilities, it was an essential learning experience that helped me grow as a developer.
